## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emil

I'm a resident at Google using machine learning to explore art and culture.

Part-time, I apply machine learning to logical tasks and art. Oh, and [I love writing](https://www.emilwallner.com/) about internet education, learning ML, and indie research. 

Say hi over email or ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EmilWallner).
