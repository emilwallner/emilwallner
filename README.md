## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emil

I'm a resident at Google using machine learning to explore art and culture. 

Part-time, I apply machine learning to logical tasks and art.

Oh, I love writing. 

[I write light posts](https://www.emilwallner.com/) on how to learn machine learning outside of Universities, research outside of Academia, and how to build financial freedom in the process.
