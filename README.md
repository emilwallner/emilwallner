ðŸ‘‹ I'm a resident at Google using machine learning to explore art and culture. 

Part-time, I'm an independent researcher in neural reasoning where I apply machine learning to logical tasks such as programming and mathematics. 

In 2018, I made a popular open-source project that translates design mock-ups into HTML/CSS, [Screenshot-to-code](https://github.com/emilwallner/Screenshot-to-code), and in early 2019 I was subject for a short-film by Google for my work on [automated colorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKPk7tG2upc). 

I used to work for the University of Oxford and co-founded a [seed investment firm](http://emerge.education/)in Education, the start-ups have rasied more than Â£100 million in follow-on funding. 

I never say no to a good sauna, love solo traveling, and often live in quirky places.
