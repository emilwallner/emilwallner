I'm currently a resident at Google using machine learning to explore art and culture. Part-time, I'm doing independent research in neural reasoning: applying machine learning to logical tasks such as programming and mathematics. 

In 2018, I made a popular open-source project that translates design mock-ups into HTML/CSS, [Screenshot-to-code](https://github.com/emilwallner/Screenshot-to-code), and in early 2019 I was subject for a short-film by Google for my work on [automated colorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xKPk7tG2upc). 

I used to work for the University of Oxford and co-founded a [seed investment firm](http://emerge.education/) focussed on education technology (59 investments).
