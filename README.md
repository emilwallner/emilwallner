## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emil

I'm a resident at Google using machine learning to explore art and culture. 

Part-time, I'm an independent researcher in neural reasoning. I apply machine learning to logical tasks such as programming and mathematics.

I never say no to a good sauna, love solo traveling, and often live in quirky places.
