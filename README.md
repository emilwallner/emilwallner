## ðŸ‘‹ I'm Emil

I'm a resident at Google using machine learning to explore art and culture. You can read about my [latest project](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-klimt-color-enigma/SQWxuZfE5ki3mQ?hl=en) in [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/artificial-intelligence-reviving-lost-art/) or [the Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/museums/gustav-klimt-google-digital-reconstructions/2021/12/28/4a18f61e-36a5-11ec-8be3-e14aaacfa8ac_story.html). 

On the side, I'm working on an ML photo editor. You can see some [early results here](https://www.reddit.com/user/emilwallner/).

Cheers!
